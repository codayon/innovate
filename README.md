## project-name: innovate

here are the links to [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [font-awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), [google-fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) & [figma](https://www.figma.com/design/ivTloZrR3Yv171T5ntmPB6/innovate?node-id=0-1&t=XPdOuxUcWPXWFfJX-1)

use `<weight>` value from 100 to 900

font-name: poppins

```
font-family: "Poppins", serif;
font-weight: <weight>;
```

font-name: nunito

```
font-family: "Nunito", serif;
font-weight: <weight>;
```

font-name: poppins

```
font-family: "Open Sans", serif;
font-weight: <weight>;
```

the more you know the better `<weight>`

```
100	Thin (Hairline)
200	Extra Light (Ultra Light)
300	Light
400	Normal (Regular)
500	Medium
600	Semi Bold (Demi Bold)
700	Bold
800	Extra Bold (Ultra Bold)
900	Black (Heavy)
```

`disclaimer:` make sure to duplicate the figma file to be able to edit and not all font weights are supported to 100-900. however, what i have seen is that, most of them supports 400-800.
